# Niflheim-api

### A collection of tools to support the Niflheim-api:
vserv.py - collects dht views from volunteer nodes.  
niflheim-api.py - presents the data via an API and Web UI  

For installation instructions, you will find them in the README.md in the api folder and the vserv folder.  

send-view.py is no longer needed to collect DHT views of the network as its now possible to crawl the network thanks to some new features in v0.3.  

Thank you to all the contributors for their views of the network.
